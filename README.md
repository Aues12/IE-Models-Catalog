# IE Models Catalog Proposal

## Introduction

In this report, I will discuss the idea of an **“Industrial Engineering Models Catalog”**.  What is meant by this, is a **Python** library or a collection of functions written in Python programming language, which are models widely used in **Industrial Engineering** domain. 

The main purpose of such a project is collecting various pre-written **model functions** for ease of use and utility. The idea is that the user can pick whichever model that suits their needs, and easily call the predefined class and function that corresponds to it.

Since we cannot write all models at once, we need to start from somewhere. But since the idea is to build a “Catalog”, we also want to structure our files in way that allows growth and further improvement. This makes deciding the architecture early on the project an important matter. Putting a greater emphasis on **software architecture** allows for a cleaner and more conscious writing.

In such a project, **clean code/documentation writing** and **simple user interface** offer great value.

## Inventory Models

I have seen a need to easily reach IE models, when I was doing my internship at a spare parts trading company. Whether it is a business environment or a research environment, easily accessing pre-programmed versions of these **mathematical models** would provide great benefits in terms of time and productivity.

The ideal way to start such a project would be starting from **basic** and **simpler** models, then to advance into more **complex** models with more **advanced features** and parameters. Therefore, we will build various EOQ Models based on the ````Basic_EOQ```` superclass.
